CFTs not only describe universality classes of systems at their second-order phase transitions, but they also describe the space of asymptotic observables for a quantum field theory (QFT) in Anti de Sitter (AdS) space of one dimension higher~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib4, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib5, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib6}.  In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the conserved stress tensor on the boundary CFT is dual to a bulk graviton, allowing us to study theories of quantum gravity by probing their dual CFT. \n\n\nThe structure of a CFT arises from its convergent and associative operator product expansion (OPE).

The conformal block is a group harmonic which resums the contributions of an irreducible representation, labeled by its lowest-weight (or “primary”) vector 𝒪𝒪\\{O}caligraphic_O, to the correlation function.  The ability to produce such a decomposition is a consequence of Plancherel’s theorem for the conformal group~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib7}.  Most importantly, this decomposition allows us to describe any four-point correlator by a countable set of “CFT data,” which consists of the spectrum {𝒪}𝒪\\{\\{O}\\}{ caligraphic_O } and OPE coefficients {λϕ⁢ϕ⁢𝒪}subscript𝜆italic-ϕitalic-ϕ𝒪\\{\\lambda_{\\phi\\phi\\{O}}\\}{ italic_λ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ italic_ϕ caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT }.  Taking a union of these data for all four-point correlators in a given theory then uniquely describes all the local observables of the CFT.1Holographically, the OPE encodes the distribution of intermediate states exchanged in a scattering process through the AdS bulk, with each term in the sum of eq.  associated with a Witten exchange diagram. \n\n\nAn important constraint arises from the associativity of the OPE, where we can equate decompositions of the correlator in different channels, corresponding to different choices of pairs of operators.  This property gives rise to the s-t channel “crossing equation”\n\n\n\n\n∑𝒪a𝒪⁢FΔ,ℓ⁢(u,v)=0,subscript𝒪subscript𝑎𝒪subscript𝐹Δℓ𝑢𝑣0\\displaystyle\\sum_{\\{O}}a_{\\{O}}F_{\\Delta,\\ell}(u,v)=0,∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Δ , roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_u , italic_v ) = 0 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nwhere a𝒪=λϕ⁢ϕ⁢𝒪2subscript𝑎𝒪subscriptsuperscript𝜆2italic-ϕitalic-ϕ𝒪a_{\\{O}}=\\lambda^{2}_{\\phi\\phi\\{O}}italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_λ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ italic_ϕ caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and\n\n\n\n\nF𝒪⁢(u,v)=u−Δϕ⁢GΔ,ℓ⁢(u,v)−v−Δϕ⁢GΔ,ℓ⁢(v,u)subscript𝐹𝒪𝑢𝑣superscript𝑢subscriptΔitalic-ϕsubscript𝐺Δℓ𝑢𝑣superscript𝑣subscriptΔitalic-ϕsubscript𝐺Δℓ𝑣𝑢\\displaystyle F_{\\{O}}(u,v)=u^{-\\Delta_{\\phi}}G_{\\Delta,\\ell}(u,v)-v^{-%\n\\Delta_{\\phi}}G_{\\Delta,\\ell}(v,u)italic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_u , italic_v ) = italic_u start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Δ , roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_u , italic_v ) - italic_v start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Δ , roman_ℓ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_v , italic_u )\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nis the crossing vector and u=z⁢z¯,v=(1−z)⁢(1−z¯)formulae-sequence𝑢𝑧¯𝑧𝑣1𝑧1¯𝑧u=z\\bar{z},\\,v=(1-z)(1-\\bar{z})italic_u = italic_z over¯ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG , italic_v = ( 1 - italic_z ) ( 1 - over¯ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG ) are the standard conformal cross ratios.  Another important constraint on the decomposition arises for unitary CFTs, and imposes that the OPE coefficients are real so that all a𝒪subscript𝑎𝒪a_{\\{O}}italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are positive.  Applying a basis of functionals to this sum rule and using the positivity of a𝒪subscript𝑎𝒪a_{\\{O}}italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT allows one to rule out certain CFT spectra by preparing a functional that produces a contradiction after acting on the proposed spectrum.  Functionals which are constructed to prove an optimal bound such as the maximum allowed scalar gap or a given OPE coefficient are called “extremal functionals,” and encode the spectrum of the correlator which saturates such a bound in their root structure.  One can implement the search for such a functional as a semi-definite program (SDP) which can be solved numerically~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib8}. \n\n\nIn the past decade, there has been tremendous growth in the numerical conformal bootstrap program yielding crucial insights into the structure of CFTs.  Notably, we can now compute precise quantum numbers of a large number of operators in the 3d Ising CFT ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib9, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib10, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib11, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib12}, the O(N) vector models ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib13, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib14, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib15}, Gross-Neveu-Yukawa CFTs ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib16, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib17}, and place nontrivial constraints on 3d gauge theories ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib18, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib19}.  These results are obtained by combining SDP constraints involving a variety of “light” correlators that relate the OPEs of relevant and marginal operators in the theory.  In each of these correlators, the OPE is dominated by light operators, so the parameter space subject to optimization is sufficiently small and the numerics are tractable. \n\n\nA class of observables that remains somewhat elusive to this treatment are four-point correlators which involve some number of irrelevant operators.  One reason for this is that correlation functions involving operators with scaling dimension much larger than the unitarity bound tend to be dominated by a large number of conformal blocks with scaling dimensions of the same order.  This makes the parameter space subject to optimization much larger than can be effectively analyzed numerically, with extremal functionals from SDP converging very slowly for larger values of ΔΔ\\Deltaroman_Δ.  If one were able to overcome these difficulties, correlators of irrelevant operators would give us better access to the large scaling dimension data of the CFT.  These data can give us insights into the mechanics of strongly-interacting multiparticle and black hole states in the dual gravitational bulk – unraveling the mysteries of which is a crucial goal in the study of quantum gravity. \n\n\nTo better clarify our observables of interest in the context of holography, consider a scalar operator ϕitalic-ϕ\\phiitalic_ϕ in a d𝑑ditalic_d-dimensional boundary CFT.  The scaling dimension of this operator is related to the mass of the corresponding bulk field by\n\n\n\n\nΔϕ⁢(Δϕ−d)=m2,subscriptΔitalic-ϕsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ𝑑superscript𝑚2\\displaystyle\\Delta_{\\phi}(\\Delta_{\\phi}-d)=m^{2},roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_d ) = italic_m start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ,\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nwhere we work in units where the AdS curvature R=1𝑅1R=1italic_R = 1.  Taking ΔϕsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT larger implies a larger mass, but how do we quantify “heavy”? When the boundary CFT has a conserved stress tensor, there is a finite central charge CTsubscript𝐶𝑇C_{T}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to which we can compare the scaling dimensions of boundary operators.2The squared OPE coefficient describing the three point coupling of two identical scalar operators ϕitalic-ϕ\\phiitalic_ϕ to the stress tensor T𝑇Titalic_T is ∝Δϕ2CTproportional-toabsentsuperscriptsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ2subscript𝐶𝑇\\propto\\frac{\\Delta_{\\phi}^{2}}{C_{T}}∝ divide start_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG where CTsubscript𝐶𝑇C_{T}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the central charge of the theory.

The exact bulk description of these operators is theory dependent, and they may be dual to strings, branes, or black holes emerging from the asymptotic boundary.  Computing boundary correlators of these operators holographically requires corrections from the presence of these extended surfaces in the bulk.  For Δϕ≲CTless-than-or-similar-tosubscriptΔitalic-ϕsubscript𝐶𝑇\\Delta_{\\phi}\\lesssim\\sqrt{C_{T}}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≲ square-root start_ARG italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG, the boundary insertions are more generally viewed as insertions of massive particles, Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes, or perhaps de-localized “blobs”~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib21, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib22} (depending on the presence of a large N𝑁Nitalic_N parameter) and can be in principle computed with Witten diagrams.  In this work, we will generally refer to any correlator with external scaling dimension Δϕ≫d−22much-greater-thansubscriptΔitalic-ϕ𝑑22\\Delta_{\\phi}\\gg\\frac{d-2}{2}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≫ divide start_ARG italic_d - 2 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG as heavy, and we will refer to the Δϕ→∞→subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}\\to\\inftyroman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT → ∞ limit as the heavy limit. \n\n\nThe majority of extant literature on heavy dynamics focuses on the case of heavy-heavy-light-light correlators, see e. g.  ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib22, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib23}.  These correlators are amenable to a variety of holographic approaches where the heavy states source a background geometry in AdS space and light operators are approximated as “probes” which travel along geodesic paths in the deformed spacetime.  These correlators can also be related to the two-point functions of light operators in a CFT at finite temperature, which describes the dynamics of a light operator scattering off an AdS black hole with the same Hawking temperature~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib24}. \n\n\nThese approaches fail in the case of heavy-heavy-heavy-heavy correlators where each of the operators is both sourcing and backreacting off of each other’s geometry.  Not only is this problem difficult within a known theory, but attempting to study them from the bootstrap perspective seems similarly intractable as there is very little known about how to effectively truncate the parameter space that characterizes them.  Unlike light correlators whose behavior is well approximated by a finite number of quantum numbers describing the low-lying spectrum, there is no such immediate “microscopic” description that captures the physics of heavy dynamics where the OPE is dominated by a large number of similarly heavy operators. \n\n\nFinite temperature calculations have been used to derive high-energy asymptotics of CFT data, including heavy-heavy-heavy OPE coefficients and the asymptotic density of states for a general dimension CFT as a function of scaling dimension and spin ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib25}.  These techniques work by describing thermal correlators as local operators coupled to background fields governed by a local “thermal” effective action on compact geometries.  On a Sβ1×Sd−1subscriptsuperscript𝑆1𝛽superscript𝑆𝑑1S^{1}_{\\beta}\\times S^{d-1}italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_β end_POSTSUBSCRIPT × italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT torus, this effective action describes a thermal partition function with inverse temperature β𝛽\\betaitalic_β and spin fugacity Ω→→Ω\\vec{\\Omega}over→ start_ARG roman_Ω end_ARG, which parametrizes “twists” of Sd−1superscript𝑆𝑑1S^{d-1}italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT along the thermal circle. \n\n\nWhen a four-point correlator of identical scalars is dominated by operators with large scaling dimension, the conformal block decomposition resembles a thermal partition function for the subset of states that show up in the OPE of the external operators.  In this limit, the effective inverse temperature is controlled by the separation of operator pairs along the cylinder −τ𝜏-\\tau- italic_τ, a 1-dimensional spin fugacity is controlled by the angular separation θ𝜃\\thetaitalic_θ of operator pairs along the cylinder, and the OPE coefficients resemble state degeneracy factors.  This leads us to consider a similar space of observables to characterize heavy correlators as we do more general thermal systems, where standard macroscopic observables such as average energy and total angular momentum can be computed by applying appropriate functionals to the correlator. \n\n\n\nIn this paper, we will study correlators of identical scalars with Δϕ≫d−22much-greater-thansubscriptΔitalic-ϕ𝑑22\\Delta_{\\phi}\\gg\\frac{d-2}{2}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≫ divide start_ARG italic_d - 2 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG using a three-fold approach.  First, in section we define and construct Riemmann-Liouville type fractional differential operators in 1, 2, and 4 dimensions that extract the principal series eigenvalues from a conformal block.  These operators resolve the 8-fold degeneracy in the eigenspace of the quadratic Casimir of the conformal group into four subspaces related by a discrete “rotation” symmetry of the Casimir eigenvalue.  Additionally, we construct the analogous operators in general dimension that extract these eigenvalues from the asymptotic conformal block at large scaling dimension.  When applied to a CFT correlator of identical scalars, these “principal series operators” compute global averages over CFT data in a given kinematic regime, weighted by powers of the quantum numbers of scaling dimension ΔΔ\\Deltaroman_Δ and total angular momentum J2subscript𝐽2J_{2}italic_J start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.  Exponentiating the principal series operators allows one to transform a correlator into a classical moment-generating function (MGF), which implies a unique decomposition of a correlator into a moment sequence that obeys the conditions from the Stieltjes moment problem in certain kinematic limits. \n\n\nSecond, in section we directly use constraints from crossing and unitarity to derive bounds and relations between these moments, focusing on the “heavy” limit of Δϕ→∞→subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}\\to\\inftyroman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT → ∞.  Previous studies have analyzed constraints from crossing in this limit~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib26} and have derived leading-order relations between moments in scaling dimension~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib27}.  We further extend these results by deriving subleading relations between moments, including those which involve some power of total angular momentum.  We then combine these relations with positivity constraints from unitarity to derive a leading bound on the covariance of the quantum numbers J2subscript𝐽2J_{2}italic_J start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ΔΔ\\Deltaroman_Δ in any crossing-symmetric OPE.  The leading relations from crossing and a corollary of the existence condition for the Stieltjes moment problem allows us to compute two-sided bounds on the leading behavior of moments in the heavy limit. \n\n\nIn section we then re-sum the moment sequences that saturate the leading bounds to derive extremal saddle-point solutions to the crossing equations in the heavy limit.  This leads us to our last fold, where we relate these solutions to particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory, and show that saddle points in the OPE distribution correspond to a decomposition into higher-spin (HS) conformal blocks which organize contributions to the GFF OPE by operators involving a fixed number of elementary scalar fields.  These HS conformal blocks are known to provide a tractable finite basis for correlators with weakly broken higher-spin symmetry ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib28}, and we present a tree-level procedure to “unmix” deformations on this basis given a number of correlators involving lighter operators in the theory.  Further, we show that the derived measures we obtain by matching only the second moment of these HS conformal blocks (and their deformations) satisfy the properties of a function which, up to a determined factor, interpolates the weights of operators in the OPE.3The weight of an operator 𝒪𝒪\\{O}caligraphic_O in a ϕ×ϕitalic-ϕitalic-ϕ\\phi\\times\\phiitalic_ϕ × italic_ϕ OPE is given by λϕ⁢ϕ⁢𝒪2⁢G𝒪⁢(z,z¯)subscriptsuperscript𝜆2italic-ϕitalic-ϕ𝒪subscript𝐺𝒪𝑧¯𝑧\\lambda^{2}_{\\phi\\phi\\{O}}G_{\\{O}}(z,\\bar{z})italic_λ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ italic_ϕ caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_z , over¯ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG ) and is thus dependent on the kinematics of the correlator.  We show that these weight-interpolating functions (WIFs) provide quantitative predictions of OPE coefficients as a continuous function of scaling dimension for correlators of sufficiently large external scaling dimension in a variety of perturbative examples.  A corollary to this observation is that the weights of operator families of fixed length become distributed along Gaussian distributions, therefore reducing the space of variables that describes them to their first few moments. \n\n\nFinally, in section we apply our tree-level saddle unmixing procedure to correlators of displacement operators in the 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect CFT in planar 𝒩=4𝒩4\\{N}=4caligraphic_N = 4 SYM, and provide some qualitative predictions about how long families of operators deform under gravitational interactions in the bulk.  We conclude with a discussion of our results in section. \n\n"

This result extends to moments the asymptotic constraints from “reflection symmetry” previously observed in~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib26, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib27}.

Hankel matrix positivity, and develop a systematic way of studying asymptotic crossing constraints.  We first want to show that moments of the form Lμ⁢[(Δ−Δ∗)−1]subscript𝐿𝜇delimited-superscriptΔsuperscriptΔ1L_{\\mu}[(\\Delta-\\Delta^{*})^{-1}]italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_μ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT [ ( roman_Δ - roman_Δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ] for some Δ∗superscriptΔ\\Delta^{*}roman_Δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∗ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT less than or equal to the unitarity bound do not dominate constraints from crossing for any ΔϕsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, so that we can safely analyze only the asymptotic constraints.

Our analysis considers different ways one can construct a heavy operator in the theory.

Additionally, we can define normal ordered products of fields ϕN≡:ϕ^N:\\phi^{N}\\equiv:\\hat{\\phi}^{N}:italic_ϕ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ≡ : over^ start_ARG italic_ϕ end_ARG start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT : by taking their OPE and subtracting off singular terms.

The moments of these deformed HS blocks characterize how the collective behavior of a family of fixed-length operators is perturbed by an interaction.

We’ll see that OPE saddles are in 1-to-1 correspondence with higher-spin (HS) conformal blocks that decompose free correlators, representing families of multi-twist operators involving a fixed number of elementary fields.  Lastly, we will present a framework for studying individual deformations on OPE saddles from tree-level perturbative correlators. \n\n"

Perhaps more interestingly, the rate at which the OPE distribution associated with a different interaction Gaussianizes is dependent on the sign of the coupling.  We find that higher-derivative interactions Gaussianize slower with a negative coupling, while lower-derivative interactions Gaussianize slower with a positive coupling.  A more in-depth analytical investigation of this saddle Gaussianization would be extremely interesting, as would tests of Gaussianization at higher order in the coupling. \n\n"

We plot the resulting corrections to the derived OPE distributions μ⁢(Δ)𝜇Δ\\mu(\\Delta)italic_μ ( roman_Δ ) as the coupling is increased for N=1,2,3,4𝑁1234N=1,2,3,4italic_N = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 in fig. , where one can see these interesting features. \n\n\nStudying the anomalous dimensions of multi-parton operators tells us about the nature of bulk physics.  Namely, the presence of an attractive bulk interaction causes the energies of multi-parton states to decrease as they become more energetically favorable field configurations.  Similar conclusions can be ascertained from the signs of anomalous moments, but through a seemingly opposite effect.  Namely, we notice a characteristic “blue shift” of normalized moments such as μ=ν1/ν0𝜇subscript𝜈1subscript𝜈0\\mu=\\nu_{1}/\\nu_{0}italic_μ = italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ν2/ν0subscript𝜈2subscript𝜈0\\nu_{2}/\\nu_{0}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.  This phenomena occurs due to the enhanced presence of heavy bound states in the distribution of intermediate states exchanged through the bulk.  On the other hand, the presence of a repulsive interaction causes a red-shift of moments as light single-particle states start to dominate the OPE. \n\n\nThis effect does not occur uniformly however, with some families of multi-parton operators enhanced and others suppressed when coupled to gravity.  This is very apparent when studying the variances of each saddle, where negative perturbations result in the variance going to zero, or the saddle becoming sharply peaked and resembling a resonance in the OPE, and positive perturbations result in the saddle becoming flattened.  It would be very interesting to see how this effect is corrected at loop order. \n\n"

          "text": "\n\n\nGiven a correlator, one would like to extract the underlying CFT data, which enables the calculation of critical exponents and provides holographic insights into bulk physics.  Light correlators tend to be governed by a small number of light states, whereas heavy correlators are dominated by numerous heavy states.  This complexity of the high-dimension spectrum poses a challenge, especially in heavy perturbative correlators, where unmixing the CFT data remains difficult even when using the Lorentzian inversion formula.  These challenges become more pronounced in holographic theories with non-renormalizable bulk interactions, where heavy states are highly sensitive to the UV behavior. \n\n\nThe approach we offer to gain insights into this challenging physics is to treat the CFT data as a coarse-grained distribution over scaling dimensions and spin, and examine how interactions affect the descriptive statistics of this smooth distribution rather than focusing on a few discrete data points.  By utilizing the basis of HS conformal blocks and their associated OPE distributions, we can gain new perspectives into the physics of heavy CFT correlators, dual to the bulk physics of heavy states, advancing our understanding of quantum many-body physics in gravitational theories. \n\n\nThe coarse-grained OPE distributions we compute offer not only qualitative insights but can also be useful quantitatively.  In section , we showed that rescaled Gaussian measures, or WIFs, converge uniformly to the exact weights of the GFF spectrum in the heavy limit.  In the interacting case, Gaussian WIFs computed from the perturbed data remain highly accurate approximations of the exact weights in the heavy limit, even at finite coupling.

This analysis is dependent on the unitary OPE being encoded by a positive definite measure over scaling dimension and total angular momentum, with the full correlator viewed as a generalized moment-generating function for the OPE distribution. \n\n\nThe latter construction relies on the existence of operators which extract the necessary powers of ΔΔ\\Deltaroman_Δ and J2=ℓ⁢(ℓ+d−2)subscript𝐽2ℓℓ𝑑2J_{2}=\\ell(\\ell+d-2)italic_J start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = roman_ℓ ( roman_ℓ + italic_d - 2 ) from the conformal block, which we construct exactly with Riemann-Liouville-type fractional derivative operators in d=1,2,𝑑12d=1,2,italic_d = 1 , 2 , and 4444, and construct asymptotically with integer-derivative operators for conformal blocks of large scaling dimension in general dimension.

The existence of this moment-generating function implies the determinancy of the moment sequence we use to characterize the correlator, and the underlying OPE distribution can be obtained via an inverse Laplace transform in the variables s,t𝑠𝑡s,titalic_s , italic_t.  Due to the additional weighting by the conformal block, the moments produced are dependent on the kinematics of the correlator.  For some kinematic regimes, namely the Lorentzian self-dual line z=1−z¯𝑧1¯𝑧z=1-\\bar{z}italic_z = 1 - over¯ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG, the conformal block is positive for all dimensions and spins, so we can study the weighted measure as a positive distribution. \n\n\nWe can use crossing symmetry to constrain moments by Taylor expanding the crossing equation around the diagonal self-dual point z=z¯=1/2𝑧¯𝑧12z=\\bar{z}=1/2italic_z = over¯ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG = 1 / 2 and imposing that the coefficients vanish at each order.  If we assume that the correlator is dominated by operators away from the unitarity bound, we may use the asymptotic conformal block to derive these constraints, and we obtain polynomial relations between moments at each finite derivative order.  Combining these constraints with a lower bound arising from the Hankel matrix positivity of the moment sequence, we find that the leading constraint at large ΔϕsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT organizes into a homogeneous polynomial in ΔΔ\\Deltaroman_Δ and ΔϕsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, implying that moments in ΔksuperscriptΔ𝑘\\Delta^{k}roman_Δ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT tend towards #⁢Δϕk#superscriptsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ𝑘\\#\\Delta_{\\phi}^{k}# roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT in the large ΔϕsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT limit.

(5.5)), where geometric “moment” methods were used to derive a window in the OPE ∼2⁢Δϕ<Δ<2⁢2⁢Δϕsimilar-toabsent2subscriptΔitalic-ϕΔ22subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\sim\\sqrt{2}\\Delta_{\\phi}<\\Delta<2\\sqrt{2}\\Delta_{\\phi}∼ square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < roman_Δ < 2 square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT guaranteed to include at least one primary operator.  It is debatable as to which one of these bounds is “stronger. ” On the one hand, the authors of ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib51} derived a rigorous statement about the presence of operator(s) in this window, but it does not give information about where operators may be clustered in this window or which operators are contributing most to the OPE.  While our bound may not constrain the locations of operators in an exact sense, it does make a strong statement that operators should be dominantly distributed in the OPE around ∼2⁢Δϕsimilar-toabsent2subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\sim\\sqrt{2}\\Delta_{\\phi}∼ square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with a maximum variance of ∼2⁢Δϕ2similar-toabsent2superscriptsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ2\\sim 2\\Delta_{\\phi}^{2}∼ 2 roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , demonstrating how the collective behavior of operator contributions is constrained by the bootstrap.  In addition, the two extremal solutions saturating our bounds contain non-identity saddles at 2⁢Δϕ2subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\sqrt{2}\\Delta_{\\phi}square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and 2⁢2⁢Δϕ22subscriptΔitalic-ϕ2\\sqrt{2}\\Delta_{\\phi}2 square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, respectively.  In this sense, we view these bounds as complimentary – one proving the existence of individual operators in this window, and the other proving that operators must collectively cluster in this window and dominate the OPE. \n\n\nWe also note that the methods used in ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib51, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib52} are qualitatively similar to ours.  Namely, they introduce the sequence of moments given by the Taylor coefficients of the correlator around the diagonal self-dual point.  This choice certainly has its benefits, in that crossing can be understood as restricting truncated moment sequences to a hyperplane in the projective moment space.  Additionally, one does not require the kind of fractional derivative operators we used to obtain the moments of a correlator.  What this method may lack however, is a more direct interpretation of each of the moments in terms of CFT data.  This makes it difficult to go from the simple (and exact) constraints from crossing to compelling statements about OPE data which extend those produced by the numerical bootstrap. \n\n\nOur method has countering strengths.  While it is difficult to analytically derive exact constraints on classical moments from crossing, the relations we are able to derive can be directly interpreted as bounds on descriptive statistics of CFT data and give insights into the global structure of the OPE.  It would be interesting to further unify our results with those presented in ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib51, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib52} by constructing an explicit mapping between the classical and geometric moment basis along with their relations from crossing.  In upcoming work, we plan to extend our analytic study to use semidefinite optimization methods to exactly constrain classical moments, augmenting bounds produced by the standard numerical bootstrap by giving new quantitative insights into the contributions of high-dimension CFT operators. \n\n\nIn addition to deriving a constraint equation for subleading terms of moments in the heavy limit (restricting to diagonal kinematics), we computed a relation between moments in the spin Casimir and scaling dimension and combined them with Hankel matrix positivity to obtain a two-sided bound on the leading term in the covariance\n\n\n\n\n0≤Cov⁢(Δ,J2)Δϕ2+O⁢(1Δϕ)≤d−12.0CovΔsubscript𝐽2superscriptsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ2𝑂1subscriptΔitalic-ϕ𝑑12\\displaystyle 0\\leq\\frac{\\text{Cov}(\\Delta,J_{2})}{\\Delta_{\\phi}^{2}}+O\\left(%\n\\frac{1}{\\Delta_{\\phi}}\\right)\\leq\\frac{d-1}{\\sqrt{2}}.0 ≤ divide start_ARG Cov ( roman_Δ , italic_J start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) end_ARG start_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG + italic_O ( divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ) ≤ divide start_ARG italic_d - 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG end_ARG . \n\n(172)\n\n\n\nThis is an intriguing result that can be thought of as a “generalized” unitarity bound on the behavior of heavy spinning operators in scalar correlators.  The standard unitarity bound for spinning operators states that Δ≥ℓ+d−2Δℓ𝑑2\\Delta\\geq\\ell+d-2roman_Δ ≥ roman_ℓ + italic_d - 2.  This naturally suggests that in a unitary OPE we should expect heavy operators to be correlated with operators with higher spin.  The lower bound in eq.  confirms this fact, and the upper bound additionally states that there is a universal bound on the rate at which average scaling dimension grows with average spin.  In future work, we plan to probe this bound in kinematic configurations away from the diagonal self-dual point, focusing on Lorentzian configurations where the OPE may become dominated by larger spin contributions.  Such bounds may be useful in understanding the distribution of operators over spin along a given Regge trajectory. \n\n\nAfter constraining the allowed moment space for unitary and crossing-symmetric correlators of identical scalars, we wanted to understand where interesting solutions to crossing lie in this moment space, and how one can reconstruct the OPE distribution of a correlator given its low-lying moments.  We first computed the “extremal” measures which have moment sequences that saturate the upper and lower bounds of eq. , and found they are given by saddle point solutions with equally weighted δ𝛿\\deltaitalic_δ-distributions at 00 and 2⁢2⁢Δϕ22subscriptΔitalic-ϕ2\\sqrt{2}\\Delta_{\\phi}2 square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for the maximal case, and a single δ𝛿\\deltaitalic_δ-distribution at 2⁢Δϕ2subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\sqrt{2}\\Delta_{\\phi}square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for the minimal case.

For Δϕ→∞→subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}\\to\\inftyroman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT → ∞ and finite N𝑁Nitalic_N, we find that the OPE distribution over scaling dimension for this correlator is approximated by N𝑁Nitalic_N non-identity saddle points distributed symmetrically around 2⁢N⁢Δϕ2𝑁subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\sqrt{2}N\\Delta_{\\phi}square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG italic_N roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT at the locations 2⁢2⁢K⁢Δϕ22𝐾subscriptΔitalic-ϕ2\\sqrt{2}K\\Delta_{\\phi}2 square-root start_ARG 2 end_ARG italic_K roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for K∈[1,N]𝐾1𝑁K\\in[1,N]italic_K ∈ [ 1 , italic_N ].  Each one of these saddles is associated with a “higher-spin” (HS) conformal block, first introduced in~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib28}, which repackages operator families of fixed length 2⁢K2𝐾2K2 italic_K, and are holographically dual to multi-parton states in the AdS bulk. \n\n\nThe approximate locations of saddles associated with the HS block decomposition were identified by studying moments of the correlator at leading order in the Δϕ→∞→subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}\\to\\inftyroman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT → ∞ limit.  As one might expect, subleading terms correct these locations and give saddle points a finite width.  By truncating computed moments at subleading order in large ΔϕsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, the derived measures associated with each saddle become Gaussian distributions with widths of order ΔϕsubscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\sqrt{\\Delta_{\\phi}}square-root start_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG.  A similar effect within the Mellin space decomposition of a tree-level Witten diagram was observed by the authors of ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib27} in a study of the flat space limit of AdS.  When the flat space limit of R→∞→𝑅R\\to\\inftyitalic_R → ∞ was taken, the sum over power laws with Gaussian weights sharpened into a δ𝛿\\deltaitalic_δ-distribution identified with a single massive pole in the flat space S-matrix.  The “Gaussianization” we observe for each saddle in the OPE is a larger collective effect, where a sum over conformal blocks with Gaussian weights appear to coalesce into δ𝛿\\deltaitalic_δ-distributions in the Δϕ→∞→subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}\\to\\inftyroman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT → ∞ limit. \n\n\nUp to a factor determined by the operator spacing of the spectrum, these Gaussian approximations for the OPE measure tend to interpolate the exact weights of operators in a given saddle, converging uniformly with errors of order 1Δϕ1subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\frac{1}{\\Delta_{\\phi}}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG roman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG as Δϕ→∞→subscriptΔitalic-ϕ\\Delta_{\\phi}\\to\\inftyroman_Δ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ϕ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT → ∞.  We verified this analytically in the free theory, and graphically for theories with an irrelevant bulk contact interaction (focusing on the t-channel identity saddle in the 𝒢1subscript𝒢1\\{G}_{1}caligraphic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT correlator).  In both cases, the weight-interpolating functions (WIFs) we derive provide quantitative predictions for OPE coefficients as a function of scaling dimension in a given saddle, using only the first three moments (including the normalization) for each saddle.  This illustrates a somewhat uncanny ability of the low-lying moment variables to capture the CFT data of high-dimension operator contributions to the OPE.  The caveat of this technique is that the actual locations of individual operators are lost, and the same WIF applies to multiple unique spectra.  That said, in correlators whose high-dimension spectrum becomes nearly dense, these WIFs seem to be the best way of predicting this non-universal data as a “coarse grained” description of a large number of operators.  It would be useful to study the effects of higher moments such as the skew and kurtosis on these WIFs, and see how precisely one can interpolate the exact weights of the conformal block decomposition.  It might also be interesting to formulate a general numerical bootstrap program for heavy correlators by studying crossing constraints on an ansatz written as a sum of (nearly) Gaussian WIFs. \n\n\nAt tree level, we showed that perturbative terms in a correlator of can be decomposed identically to the HS block decomposition of the free correlator.  This leads us to consider deformations on HS blocks as a means to reorganize terms in the perturbative correlator, where each deformed HS conformal block encodes how states with a fixed parton number are collectively perturbed by an interaction.  By studying 𝒢Ksubscript𝒢𝐾\\{G}_{K}caligraphic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT correlators for K∈[1,N]𝐾1𝑁K\\in[1,N]italic_K ∈ [ 1 , italic_N ], we are able to unmix perturbative terms to reorganize them into the deformed HS block basis.  We contrast this technique with the more ambitious goal of standard operator unmixing, where one desires to compute the individual anomalous data for a set of degenerate operators.  It will be interesting to extend this analysis to mixed correlators (or higher-point functions), where one could study the effect of deformations on higher-twist families of operators. \n\n\nMore generally, decomposing correlators into families of operators with fixed length is reminiscent of the cluster expansion of a thermal partition function in small fugacity z=exp−β⁢μ≪1𝑧superscript𝛽𝜇much-less-than1z=\\exp^{-\\beta\\mu}\\ll 1italic_z = roman_exp start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_β italic_μ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ≪ 1~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib53}.  These expansions are used to study interacting many-body systems because, unlike a standard perturbative series in small coupling, cluster expansions in z𝑧zitalic_z are convergent, with each term corresponding to contributions from states involving a fixed number of particles.  Similar to our formulation of deformed HS conformal blocks, order zNsuperscript𝑧𝑁z^{N}italic_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT terms in the cluster expansion, or N𝑁Nitalic_N-particle “Slater sums,” are expressed graphically as a linear combination of N𝑁Nitalic_N diagrams with K∈[1,N]𝐾1𝑁K\\in[1,N]italic_K ∈ [ 1 , italic_N ] connected pieces.  Since this cluster expansion is convergent, it could be useful to further import these techniques to the study of CFT.  This would invite the possibility of bootstrapping deformed HS blocks, giving us novel insights into the dynamics of long operator families in strongly-interacting theories. \n\n\nIn a recent series of papers ~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib49, https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib50}, the authors unmixed the anomalous data of operators in the 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect in planar 𝒩=4𝒩4\\{N}=4caligraphic_N = 4 SYM, working up to operators with length 6 by studying correlators of displacement operators of the form ⟨𝒟p⁢𝒟p⁢𝒟q⁢𝒟q⟩delimited-⟨⟩subscript𝒟𝑝subscript𝒟𝑝subscript𝒟𝑞subscript𝒟𝑞\\\\{D}_{p}\\{D}_{p}\\{D}_{q}\\{D}_{q}\\⟨ caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⟩.  The authors note that unmixing the anomalous data of longer operators requires a larger set of correlators to resolve the degeneracy space, making it exceptionally challenging to understand perturbations on operators with very large lengths.  Using their tree-level results, our work attempts to probe deformations of families of long operators without such a microscopic description, instead opting to understand how the statistics describing these operator families are perturbed by computing the moments of their associated deformed HS blocks.  Our result gives a novel way to describe how exceptionally long families of operators are collectively perturbed, and we tabulated the perturbed means, variances, and weights of saddles in the OPE distribution over scaling dimension. \n\n\nWhile we only presented results up to operators of length 18, our technique can be applied to arbitrarily long operators.  These results are promising, and currently seem to be the only tractable way of understanding the heavy CFT data in perturbative correlators like these.  That said, these results are only computed at tree level and one quickly loses perturbative control when considering operator families with length ≥8absent8\\geq 8≥ 8 due to the non-renormalizability of the bulk interaction.  In the future, we hope to generalize this procedure to higher-loop order and consider effects from additional operator families entering the OPE.  It would be especially exciting to study bulk gravitational physics from the saddle perspective, e. g. the role of exchanged black hole states vs multi-parton states. \n\n\nOne particularly intriguing effect we noticed at tree level was the alternating collapse and resonance of saddles depending on the parity of the saddle index K𝐾Kitalic_K.  This effect seems reminiscent of what one may expect from conformal multiplet recombination, where distinct HS multiplets combine via the equations of motion to form a single HS multiplet~\\cite{https://arxiv. org/html/2501.00092v1#bib.bib54}.  It may be the case that the saddle collapse we observe here indeed corresponds to those multi-parton states recombining with a set of states with different parton number after interactions are introduced.  If we considered e. g. a saddle point analysis of a ⟨ϕ3⁢ϕ3⁢ϕ3⁢ϕ3⟩delimited-⟨⟩superscriptitalic-ϕ3superscriptitalic-ϕ3superscriptitalic-ϕ3superscriptitalic-ϕ3\\\\phi^{3}\\phi^{3}\\phi^{3}\\phi^{3}\\⟨ italic_ϕ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ϕ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ϕ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ϕ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⟩ correlator near the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in 4−ϵ4italic-ϵ4-\\epsilon4 - italic_ϵ dimensions, we might expect a similar saddle collapse to occur when ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\epsilon>0italic_ϵ > 0 as the set of length 6 operators mixes with length 2 and 4 operators via the relation ϕ3∝□⁢ϕproportional-tosuperscriptitalic-ϕ3□italic-ϕ\\phi^{3}\\propto\\Box\\phiitalic_ϕ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∝ □ italic_ϕ.  Exploring the evolution of saddles in perturbative examples such as this may help to give new insights into the structure of CFT correlators. \n\n\nAcknowledgements.
